# Mapping_Earthquakes
Data visualization specialist with the disaster Reporting Network. Non profit company that gives dat driven stories on disasters around the world. Mkae insightful data visualizations with interactive features on earthquakes from around the world. Basil, head of earthwuake disaster response team beleives this project will be useful for his tem which includes reporters and data visualization specialists. Hopes that making earthwuake maps informative and easy to use on desktop and mobile phones wil genreate positive buzz about the disaster reporting network. My role will support website and mobile application development by using the latest earthwuake geojson data from the US geological survey website. Will traverse and retrieve the data using javascript and d3 and leaflet libraries and plot data on mapbox map through an api request. On the map, the magnitude and location of each earthwuake will be shown as a popup marker, diameters of the markers will reflect the magnitude of the earthwuake in their size and colour. Earthwuakes with higher magnitudes will appear larger and darker in colour, with a legend providing the context for the map data. Finally to illustrate the relationship between the location and frequency of sizemic activity and tectonic plates, youll add fault lines on the map. If done right, i can work for the team

Purpose
The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.

Tasks
To complete this project, use a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website and retrieve geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days. Then add the data to a map.

Approach
Your approach will be to use the JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. You'll use the Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data.

Now that you have an overview of the project plan, let's set up a Mapbox account and get the API token you'll need to create geographical maps.

Basil and Sadhana like how you created your earthquake map with two different maps and the earthquake overlay. Now, Basil and Sadhana would like to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and they would like to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and they would like to see the data on a third map.
